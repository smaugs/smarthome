Sample Plugin (old v1.1)
========================

Use this skeleton only if you need backward compatibility to SmartHomeNG v1.1 up to SmartHomeNG v1.3.
If you are using this skeleton you are missing out new features of SmartHomeNG v1.4.

On this page you find files for writing a new plugin. The plugin consist of a file with Python
code (__init__.py) and a documentation file (README.md). A skeleton of both files is shown below.

A formatted version of the sample README.md can be found here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :glob:
   :titlesonly:

   /dev/sample_plugin_old_v1_1/README.md

A raw version of the README.md for copy and paste can be found below the Python source code.



.. literalinclude:: /dev/sample_plugin_old_v1_1/__init__.py
    :caption: __init__.py


The following file outlines the minimum documentation a plugin should have. This README file
should be written in English.
